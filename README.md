## Intro to Node modules

Just a lightweight intro to using Node modules.
Task was to write some wrappers for existing fs and crypto modules.

To Do
- Add error handling to move and copy
- Add directory traversal/creation throughout.
- Replace openSync call in write function to make entire module Async
